Standalone multimodal b-roll search: link any folder of footage, search by text or image, jump to the source clip in your file manager.

Python FastAPI backend + TypeScript (Vite) frontend. Embeddings via **Jina v5-omni-small**; kNN via **Elasticsearch HNSW**.

Built on the retrieval pipeline from the [omnishot-benchmark](https://github.com/jdarmada/omnishot-benchmark) repo: this app is the editor-facing search tool, while the benchmark studies how far video embeddings can be compressed.

## Quick start (Docker)

The fastest way to try it — one command runs Elasticsearch + the app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jdarmada/omnishot
cd omnishot
cp .env.example .env      # set JINA_API_KEY (free key at jina.ai)
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:8001** and drop video files into `./clips`.

> Docker mode watches the mounted `./clips` folder. The native folder picker
> and Reveal button need the backend running directly on your machine — see
> [Run the app](#run-the-app) below for the local setup.

**Layout of data**

| What | Where | Who owns it |
|---|---|---|
| Source videos (your library) | Any folder you link | You — add/delete in Finder |
| Scene chunks + embeddings | `./chunks` + Elasticsearch | App (derived; safe to wipe) |
| Default starter folder | `./clips` | Convenience default until you change it |

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Node.js 18+** (frontend)
- **ffmpeg** (chunking + proxy compression)
  ```bash
  # macOS
  brew install ffmpeg

  # Ubuntu / Debian
  sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
  ```
- **Docker Desktop** (recommended for local Elasticsearch)
- A free **[Jina API key](https://jina.ai)**

---

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jdarmada/omnishot
cd omnishot

# Python
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# Config
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env — at minimum set JINA_API_KEY
```

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `JINA_API_KEY` | Yes | Embeddings for ingest + search |
| `ES_URL` | Yes | `http://localhost:9200` or your cloud URL |
| `ES_API_KEY` | No | Needed for secured / cloud clusters |
| `PEXELS_API_KEY` | No | Only for `download_pexels.py` |
| `WATCH_DIR` | No | Initial library folder (default `./clips`) |
| `CHUNKS_DIR` | No | Scene chunk output (default `./chunks`) |
| `BROLL_INDEX` | No | ES index name (default `broll`) |

The linked library path is also persisted in `chunks/.library.json` after you change it in the UI.

---

## Start Elasticsearch

```bash
docker compose up -d elasticsearch
curl http://localhost:9200   # should return cluster info
```

Or point `ES_URL` / `ES_API_KEY` at Elastic Cloud and skip Docker.

---

## Run the app

**Terminal 1 — backend** (from repo root, venv active):

```bash
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload --port 8001
```

**Terminal 2 — frontend**:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**.

### Link a library folder

1. Click **Change folder…** — a native OS dialog opens on the machine running the backend
2. Pick any folder of `.mp4` / `.mov` / `.mkv` / `.webm` footage
3. The app indexes that folder (and subfolders). Switching folders clears the previous search corpus and rebuilds from the new path

**Add clips:** copy or save videos into the linked folder.  
**Remove from search:** move or delete the file in the file manager — the watcher drops it from Elasticsearch within a few seconds.

You can also set the path via API without the dialog:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/library \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"path":"/Users/you/Movies/B-roll"}'
```

### Categories

Chunks are automatically sorted into browseable categories (nature, people,
urban, animals, …) shown as chips on the home page. Because Jina embeds text
and video into the same space, each category is just a short text description
embedded once — every chunk is assigned to its closest category at ingest
time using the embedding it already has, so **new footage joins the right
category automatically** with zero extra API calls. Chunks that don't fit
anywhere land in "other".

To define your own categories, write `chunks/.categories.json`:

```json
{
  "drone shots": "aerial drone footage looking down from above",
  "interviews": "a person talking to the camera, interview setup"
}
```

then delete `chunks/.category_anchors.json` and restart — existing chunks are
re-sorted on startup. Tune the assignment strictness with `CATEGORY_MIN_SIM`
(default 0.15; higher sends more chunks to "other").

### What you can do in the UI

- **Text search** — describe the shot visually
- **Hybrid search** — toggle **Hybrid** to fuse semantic search with keyword (BM25) matching over filenames, categories, and transcripts, combined with reciprocal-rank fusion. Useful when your files have meaningful names like `beach_sunset_drone.mp4`
- **Image search** — click **Image** to upload a reference, or drag one onto the search bar
- **≈ More** — find visually similar clips (reuses the stored vector, no Jina call)
- **Reveal** — open the source file in Finder / Explorer / file manager (the original in your library)

### Production-style (single port)

```bash
cd frontend && npm run build && cd ..
uvicorn backend.app:app --port 8001
```

Then open **http://localhost:8001** (backend serves `frontend/dist`).

---

## Download videos

Point downloads at your library folder (or at `./clips`, then **Change folder…** to that path).

### Option A: Pexels (short stock clips)

Needs `PEXELS_API_KEY` in `.env`.

```bash
python scripts/download_pexels.py --out ./clips --total 50
python scripts/download_pexels.py --out ~/Movies/B-roll --total 30 --categories nature urban
```

### Option B: YouTube (longer clips, more scenes each)

```bash
python scripts/download_youtube.py --out ./clips --total 20
python scripts/download_youtube.py --out ~/Movies/B-roll --categories nature animals
```

Both scripts checkpoint progress so interrupted runs resume cleanly. If yt-dlp hits 403s: `pip install -U yt-dlp`.

---

## Batch ingest (optional preload)

For a large folder before opening the UI:

```bash
python scripts/ingest.py --clips ~/Movies/B-roll --cache ./chunks/.embed_cache.json
```

Then set the same path as the library (UI or `POST /api/library`) so the watcher does not re-embed files already in the manifest.

---

## How it works

```
library folder  →  scene chunk (PySceneDetect)  →  640px proxy  →  Jina embed
                                                                →  Elasticsearch kNN
```

Membership follows the filesystem: files in the linked folder are searchable; files removed from it leave the corpus. Chunk files under `./chunks` are app-owned derivatives.

---

## Security

This is a **local tool** — it opens file dialogs and your file manager on the
machine running the backend, and it has no authentication. It binds to
`127.0.0.1` by default. **Do not expose it to the public internet.** See
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full threat model and how to report
vulnerabilities.

## Contributing

Dev setup, test commands, and extension points (including how to swap in a
different embedding provider) are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
Releases are tracked in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

```bash
pytest                        # backend tests — no ES or API keys needed
ruff check .                  # Python lint
cd frontend && npm run lint   # TypeScript lint
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**`Connection refused` on port 9200** — Docker isn't running, or ES is still starting. Wait ~15s after `docker compose up -d`.

**`compatible-with` version error** — Install an ES 9.x client: `pip install "elasticsearch>=9.0.0"`.

**Backend offline in the UI** — Confirm uvicorn is on port 8001; Vite proxies `/api` there.

**Change folder… does nothing** — The dialog runs on the **server** host (same machine as uvicorn). On Linux install `zenity` or `kdialog`. Cancelled dialogs are ignored.

**Reveal does nothing on Linux** — Opens the parent folder via `xdg-open` (macOS uses Finder `open -R`, Windows uses Explorer `/select`).
