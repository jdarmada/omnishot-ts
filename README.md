Multimodal Media search: link any folder of footage, search by text or image, jump to the source clip in your file manager.

Python FastAPI backend + TypeScript (Vite) frontend. Embeddings via [jina-embeddings-v5-omni-small](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-embeddings-v5-omni-small); kNN via **Elasticsearch HNSW**.

## Quick start (Docker)


```bash
git clone https://github.com/jdarmada/omnishot
cd omnishot
cp .env.example .env      # set JINA_API_KEY (free key at jina.ai)
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:8001** and drop video files into `./clips`.

> Docker mode watches the mounted `./clips` folder. The native folder picker
> and Reveal button need the backend running directly on your machine — see
> [Run the app](#run-the-app) below for the local setup.

**Layout of data**

| What | Where | Who owns it |
|---|---|---|
| Source videos (your library) | Any folder you link | You — add/delete in Finder |
| Scene chunks + embeddings | `./chunks` + Elasticsearch | App (derived; safe to wipe) |
| Default starter folder | `./clips` | Convenience default until you change it |

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Node.js 18+** (frontend)
- **ffmpeg** (chunking + proxy compression)
  ```bash
  # macOS
  brew install ffmpeg

  # Ubuntu / Debian
  sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
  ```
- **Docker Desktop** (recommended for local Elasticsearch)
- A free **[Jina API key](https://jina.ai)**

---

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jdarmada/omnishot
cd omnishot

# Python
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# Config
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env — at minimum set JINA_API_KEY
```

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `JINA_API_KEY` | Yes | Embeddings for ingest + search |
| `ES_URL` | Yes* | Elasticsearch endpoint URL (any deployment type) |
| `ES_CLOUD_ID` | No* | Alternative to `ES_URL` for managed Elastic Cloud |
| `ES_API_KEY` | No | Required for Cloud and Serverless; blank for local Docker |
| `PEXELS_API_KEY` | No | Only for `download_pexels.py` |
| `WATCH_DIR` | No | Initial library folder (default `./clips`) |
| `CHUNKS_DIR` | No | Scene chunk output (default `./chunks`) |
| `BROLL_INDEX` | No | ES index name (default `broll`) |

\* Set either `ES_URL` or `ES_CLOUD_ID`. The linked library path is persisted in `chunks/.library.json` after you change it in the UI.

## Choosing an Elasticsearch deployment

The app runs unchanged against local Docker, a managed Elastic Cloud
deployment, or Elastic Cloud Serverless — pick one in `.env`.

### Local Docker (default)

```bash
docker compose up -d elasticsearch
curl http://localhost:9200   # should return cluster info
```

```dotenv
ES_URL=http://localhost:9200
ES_API_KEY=
```

Security is disabled in the compose file and the port binds to localhost
only, so no key is needed.

### Elastic Cloud (managed)

From your deployment page, copy the Elasticsearch endpoint and
[create an API key](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/api-keys.html):

```dotenv
ES_URL=https://my-deployment.es.us-west1.gcp.cloud.es.io:443
ES_API_KEY=<your key>
```

Or use the deployment's **Cloud ID** instead of the URL:

```dotenv
ES_CLOUD_ID=my-deployment:dXMtd2VzdDEuZ2NwLi4u
ES_API_KEY=<your key>
```

### Elastic Cloud Serverless

From your project's overview page, copy the Elasticsearch endpoint and
create an API key:

```dotenv
ES_URL=https://my-project-abc123.es.us-east-1.aws.elastic.cloud:443
ES_API_KEY=<your key>
```

Everything this app uses (kNN, aggregations, bulk indexing) is supported on
Serverless; index sizing and shard tuning are managed for you.

### Switching between deployments

Edit `.env` and restart the backend — that's it. On startup the app checks
which of your clips exist in the connected cluster and automatically
re-indexes any that are missing, reusing cached embeddings from
`chunks/.embed_cache.json`, so **moving between deployments never re-pays
the embedding API**. Your old cluster's data is left untouched (delete its
index manually if you're done with it).

Verify what you're connected to at any time:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8001/api/health
# → {"elasticsearch": true, "deployment": {"flavor": "default", "version": "9.4.3", ...}}
# flavor is "serverless" on Serverless
```

---

## Run the app

**Terminal 1 — backend** (from repo root, venv active):

```bash
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload --port 8001
```

**Terminal 2 — frontend**:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**.

### Link a library folder

1. Click **Change folder…** — a native OS dialog opens on the machine running the backend
2. Pick any folder of `.mp4` / `.mov` / `.mkv` / `.webm` footage
3. The app indexes that folder (and subfolders). Switching folders clears the previous search corpus and rebuilds from the new path

**Add clips:** copy or save videos into the linked folder.  
**Remove from search:** move or delete the file in the file manager — the watcher drops it from Elasticsearch within a few seconds.

You can also set the path via API without the dialog:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/library \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"path":"/Users/you/Movies/B-roll"}'
```

### What you can do in the UI

- **Text search** — describe the shot visually
- **Image search** — click **Image** to upload a reference, or drag one onto the search bar
- **≈ More** — find visually similar clips (reuses the stored vector, no Jina call)
- **Reveal** — open the source file in Finder / Explorer / file manager (the original in your library)

### Production-style (single port)

```bash
cd frontend && npm run build && cd ..
uvicorn backend.app:app --port 8001
```

Then open **http://localhost:8001** (backend serves `frontend/dist`).

---

## Download sample videos

Point downloads at your library folder (or at `./clips`, then **Change folder…** to that path).

### Option A: Pexels (short stock clips)

Needs `PEXELS_API_KEY` in `.env`.

```bash
python scripts/download_pexels.py --out ./clips --total 50
python scripts/download_pexels.py --out ~/Movies/B-roll --total 30 --categories nature urban
```

### Option B: YouTube (longer clips, more scenes each)

```bash
python scripts/download_youtube.py --out ./clips --total 20
python scripts/download_youtube.py --out ~/Movies/B-roll --categories nature animals
```

Both scripts checkpoint progress so interrupted runs resume cleanly. If yt-dlp hits 403s: `pip install -U yt-dlp`.

---

## Batch ingest (optional preload)

For a large folder before opening the UI:

```bash
python scripts/ingest.py --clips ~/Movies/B-roll --cache ./chunks/.embed_cache.json
```

Then set the same path as the library (UI or `POST /api/library`) so the watcher does not re-embed files already in the manifest.

---

## How it works

```
library folder  →  scene chunk (PySceneDetect)  →  640px proxy  →  Jina embed
                                                                →  Elasticsearch kNN
```

Membership follows the filesystem: files in the linked folder are searchable; files removed from it leave the corpus. Chunk files under `./chunks` are app-owned derivatives.

---

## Security

This is a **local tool** — it opens file dialogs and your file manager on the
machine running the backend, and it has no authentication. It binds to
`127.0.0.1` by default. **Do not expose it to the public internet.** See
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full threat model and how to report
vulnerabilities.

## Contributing

Dev setup, test commands, and extension points (including how to swap in a
different embedding provider) are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
Releases are tracked in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

```bash
pytest                        # backend tests — no ES or API keys needed
ruff check .                  # Python lint
cd frontend && npm run lint   # TypeScript lint
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**`Connection refused` on port 9200** — Docker isn't running, or ES is still starting. Wait ~15s after `docker compose up -d`.

**`compatible-with` version error** — Install an ES 9.x client: `pip install "elasticsearch>=9.0.0"`.

**Backend offline in the UI** — Confirm uvicorn is on port 8001; Vite proxies `/api` there.

**Change folder… does nothing** — The dialog runs on the **server** host (same machine as uvicorn). On Linux install `zenity` or `kdialog`. Cancelled dialogs are ignored.

**Reveal does nothing on Linux** — Opens the parent folder via `xdg-open` (macOS uses Finder `open -R`, Windows uses Explorer `/select`).
